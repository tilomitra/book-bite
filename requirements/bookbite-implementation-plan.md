# BookBite iOS Application - Implementation Plan

## Product Overview
BookBite is an iOS application for discovering and reading concise (<10-minute) summaries of non-fiction books. The app features role-specific workplace application guidance, confidence indicators with citations, comparative book views, and export capabilities. This MVP version operates entirely offline with local JSON data.

## 1. User Stories

### Core User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to search for books by title or author so that I can quickly find books I'm interested in.
2. **As a user**, I want to view detailed book information including cover, metadata, and structured summaries so that I can understand the book's key concepts.
3. **As a user**, I want to see confidence indicators on key ideas so that I can assess the reliability of the information.
4. **As a user**, I want to access citations and sources so that I can verify claims and explore further.
5. **As a user**, I want to see role-specific "How to Apply at Work" sections so that I can immediately use the insights in my professional context.
6. **As a user**, I want to compare two books side-by-side so that I can understand their different perspectives on similar topics.
7. **As a user**, I want to export summaries as PDF or mind map so that I can reference them offline or share with colleagues.
8. **As a user**, I want to see reading time estimates so that I can plan my learning sessions.
9. **As a user**, I want to bookmark books for later reading so that I can build a personal reading list.
10. **As a user**, I want to see who should read each book so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Search & Discovery
- **Full-text search** across title, author, and categories fields
- **Real-time filtering** as user types with debouncing
- **Search results** display book cover thumbnails, title, author, and reading time
- **Empty state** with suggested popular books when no search query
- **Skeleton loaders** during data loading operations

### Book Detail View
- **Header section** with book cover, title, authors, publication info
- **Tabbed navigation** for different summary sections:
  - Overview (one-sentence hook + key ideas)
  - How to Apply (workplace-specific guidance)
  - Critical Analysis (pitfalls + critiques)
  - References (citations + sources)
- **Confidence badges** on key ideas (High/Medium/Low with visual indicators)
- **Citation links** that open in Safari when tapped
- **Reading time indicator** prominently displayed
- **Regenerate button** to simulate different summary generation (reads alternate JSON)

### Comparison View
- **Side-by-side layout** for iPad, stacked for iPhone
- **Synchronized scrolling** option for parallel reading
- **Highlight differences** in key ideas between books
- **Common themes** identification across both books

### Export Features
- **PDF generation** with formatted one-page summary
- **Mind map export** as image with hierarchical structure
- **Share sheet integration** for standard iOS sharing

### Data Management
- **Local JSON loading** from app bundle
- **In-memory caching** of parsed JSON data
- **Mock async operations** to simulate network delays
- **Error handling** for malformed JSON

## 3. App Architecture

### Pattern: MVVM + Repository

### Dependency Injection Strategy
```swift
// Simple composition root for easy backend swap later
class DependencyContainer {
    lazy var bookRepository: BookRepository = LocalBookRepository()
    lazy var searchService = SearchService(repository: bookRepository)
    lazy var exportService = ExportService()
    
    // Future: Replace with NetworkBookRepository
}
```
